# wordpressScraper
Counts how many instances of a list of words show up in a webnovel. Outputs the link to each chapter with at least one occurance to a folder.

Separate words by a single comma.
Can be modified to work with other webnovels, line 22 would have to be modified, and obviously line 12.

Please note that this scraper is extremely slow. I will not be implementing caching as that flirts with the idea of creating copies of the series. I do not intend to contend (heh, nice rhyme) with the law, nor do I wish to provide tools for people to make illegal ebooks.
